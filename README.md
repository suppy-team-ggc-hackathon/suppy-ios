# Suppy

The Supply Chain App

In this repository you will find a prototype version as result of taking part at the HLAG Blockchain Hackathon 2018.

### What is this app for?

It should be an easy tool that the user can download from the App store to check the history of a certain product.
Let's say the next time that you go shopping, you would like to check from where your product an its ingredient come.
For this we have come up with an App that allows cosumers and providers to easy access to a supply chain solution that leverages the power of the Blockchain Technology.

We have also developed a backend service for this app, that communicates with the Multichain RPC interface provided by SAP.
